# README outline

## **Project Overview**

-The purpose of this project is to show the evolution of the top grossing films from each decade. As the user scrolls down, the time period changes. Each time period shows the top rated movie that was released in that decade with a brief description. The background changes based on the color scheme of the screenshots from the movie. 


## **Figma Design**

- Briefly explain the design process and how the layout was planned in Figma.
I knew I wanted the user to scroll and see the decades change as they scroll down. I made one long frame and added rectangles that acted as each decade. I then added the description of each film along with the title. 
**Features**

  - **Animations**: I used GSAP effects to cause the text to scale and fade in. 

  - **User-triggered Events**: Users can interact with the page by scrolling down to see different sections. Each section has the animations listed above that activate as the user scrolls.

  - **Responsive Design**: The design automatically adjusts to fit different devices by using flexible widths and font sizes. 


## **Technologies Used**

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: (e.g., GSAP for animations)
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## **Live Demo**

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.



## **Credits**

-Many screenshots from iMDB and Google, as well as a font from Google Fonts. 

I used a lot of tutorials on youtube, stack overflow, the GSAP website, and chatGPT to help



## **Future Enhancements**

- List any features you wouldâ€™ve liked to add if given more time
I wanted there to be a horizontal timeline floating as the user scrolls so that if the user wants to jump to a specific decade, they can just by pressing that button.
